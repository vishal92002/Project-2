    <h1>What is AAA Testing: </h1>

    AAA or Arrange,Act, Assert is a system that can be used to write unit tests.<br><br> 
    
    There are a few criterias that you need to keep in mind when writing test cases using AAA method: <br> 

    As long as there are less than three lines of code in a test, they appear without any special formatting or white space.<br><br>
 
    When a test contains more than three lines of code, you separate the three phases with a blank line.<br><br> 
 
    When a single phase contains so many lines of code that you'll need to divide it into subsections to make it readable, you should explicitly mark the beginning of each phase with a code comment. <br> <br> 

    AAA testing is important becasue you need to run diffrent test senarious to make sure that your code is working properly. Aslo you need to make sure that all the standareds are met. <br><br>

    If you need to use external data for testing, you can do this by having a .CSV file and having a class in your code that is able to read the contents of those files and pass those in your test files <br> <br>
