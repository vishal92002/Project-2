<h1>Calc Program and Speration of Concerns</h1>

<h2>What is sepration Of concerns</h2>

Sepration of concerns is a design principle that separates the progrma into diffrent sections. <br>
The overall goal is to create a well organized system where each part of the code fullfills a requirment and can be understood and changed easily.<br>

This is achiced through setting boundraies. Boundares are any logical or physical constraint which delineates a given set of responsibilities<br>
