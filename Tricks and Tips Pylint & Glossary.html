    <h1>Object-Oriented Programming Terms</h1><br>

    Here is a list of Object Oriented Prgramming Terms that you should know: <br><br> 

Factory: An Object that is used to create other objects <br> <br>

Instantiation: the recreation of other objects. <br> <br>

Object: data that has unique attributes and behavior <br><br>

Class:  A set of properties and methods that are common to all objects of the same type.<br><br>

Method: A block of statements that has a name and can be executed by calling it from other classes. <br> <br> 
  
Namespace: also known as packages, allow programmers to create small private areas where they can declare classes. The names of these classes will not coincide with other classes with the same name. <br><br>

Constructor: special type of method that is used to initialize objects. It is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for objects. <br><br>

Static: Keyword that indicates that the particular member belongs to type itself. <br><br>

Public:<br><br>

Private: an access modifier used for classes, attributes, methods and constructors, making them accessible by any other class.<br><br>

Protected:access modifier for method and variable of a class that can only be accessed by the following: <br> 
    Within the enclosing class <br>
    Other classes in the same package <br>
    Sub classes <br>
<br> 
Property:is a file extension for files mainly used to store the configurable parameters of an application <br><br>

<h1> Pylint Tricks And Tips: </h1>

What is Pylint <br><br> 
Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in python code. It can check for small errors such as syntax errors and can also  make suggestions on how you can make your code better. <br>
Pylint will display a number of messages as it analyzes the code and it can also be used for displaying some statistics about the number of warnings and errors found in different files. <br>  
The messages are classified under various categories such as errors and warnings. <br><br>

Pylint is a good tool to know becasue it will make your code look more prfssional and it will make it look like you knw whats going on <br><br> 

When you have multipal errors each error will show on its own line <br> <br>

 Each error shows the root folder and the file and the line where the error is located.<br><ibr> 

 you can also see the coverage in pylint. This checks to see if all the lines have been exacuted <br><br>

 Here are a few examples from the calculator program that shows Pylint and it working: 

 Without Coverage: <br><br>
    
    <img src="C:\Users\visha\Pictures\test errors.PNG"/><br><br> 

    As you can see, there are a few erros in my code that I have to correct, notice as I mentiioned above, there is the location of the error and what the error is. <br><br>

 With Coverage: <br><br> 
 <img src= "C:\Users\visha\Pictures\With Coverage.PNG"/><br><br> 

    If you run pylint with coverage, you will show you the errors like the example and it will also show you the coverage of your code. This is hecking if all the lines in my code have been exacuted<br> 
    as you can see there are a few lins that are not exacuted due to the fact that it is just an empty line that is used for formatting reasons. <br><br>
